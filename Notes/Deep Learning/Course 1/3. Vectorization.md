# 3. Vectorization

- Vectorization is a technique that allows us to perform operations on entire arrays or matrices instead of looping through each element individually.

- In a vectorized implementation, you can directly compute the dot product without using a for loop. This is done using built-in functions like np.dot() in Python or numpy.

#### 1.1 More Examples

1. Matrix multiplication
2. Element-wise operartions
3. Mathematical functions

#### -----
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3,4])
print(a)
[1 2 3 4]

#### ----
import time
a = np.random.rand(1000000)
b = np.random.rand(1000000)
tic = time.time()
c = np.dot(a,b)
toc = time.time()
print("Vectorized version: " + str(1000*(toc-tic)) + " ms")
Vectorized version: 2.9947757720947266 ms


2. Vectorizing Logistic Regression
- We stack our training inputs together in a matrix called X, and then we can compute all the Z values at once using a single line of code.

- Similarly, we can compute all the activation values at once using another line of code. This saves us a lot of time and makes our code much faster.
