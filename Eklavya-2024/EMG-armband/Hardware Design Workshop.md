It can not always be efficient to directly jump and start designing the hardware in CAD. That is why we need to first have a rough design layed out.

  

## The Pen and Paper Approach

- Understanding the Problem Statement
- Understanding the situation and the probable situation the part will face
    - Eg. A rocket will face aerodynamic drag during take off. It also has to endure high speeds.
- Understanding the criteria of size, shape and design.

  

The most important prerequisite is Engineering Graphics and Machine Design:

- Front Top and Side view
- Angle

  

- Wastes a lot of time
- Design Imperfections
- Having ideas will result to changes in CAD
- Efficiency Issues

  

  

# Part Designing

  

# Types of Analysis

  

- Static Structural Analysis
- Aerodynamic Analysis
- Thermal Analysis
- Dynamic Analysis
- Fluid Flow Analysis

  

## Static Structural Analysis

Procuedure:

1. Force Calculation
2. Stress Strain Calculation
3. Deformation mapping

  

**Assigning a Filet to parts where huge stress acts can even out the stress distribution**
