collects EMG (electromyography) data, filters it, and performs a frequency analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

a) Data collection:
- It reads analog data from a sensor connected to the ESP32.
- The data is sampled at a rate of 500 times per second.

b) Signal processing:
- The raw signal goes through a bandpass filter to focus on frequencies between 75 and 150 Hz.
- This filtering helps remove noise and focus on the most relevant part of the EMG signal.

c) Frequency analysis:
- The code uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the time-domain signal into frequency components.
- This helps identify which frequencies are most prominent in the EMG signal.

ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter): Converts the continuous analog signal from the sensor into digital values the microcontroller can process.
Bandpass filter: A filter that allows signals between two specific frequencies to pass through while blocking others.

# Program flow:
   - The program continuously reads data from the ADC.
   - It applies the bandpass filter to each sample.
   - Once it collects 256 samples, it performs the FFT.
   - After the FFT, it prints out the magnitude of each frequency component.
   - This process repeats.

# Key functions:
   - `app_main()`: The main function that runs the data collection and processing loop.
   - `bandpass_filter_75_150()`: Applies the bandpass filter to the input signal.
   - `fft()`: Performs the Fast Fourier Transform on the collected samples.


basically a simple EMG analizer made using esp32.
