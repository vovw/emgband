## interesting findings
### hardware
how to create both positive and negative voltage supplies using two 9V batteries.

### Signal Acquisition and Conditioning
The guide walks through several stages:
1. Using an INA106 chip for initial signal measurement
2. Amplifying the signal with TL072 chips
3. Rectifying the signal to prepare it for a microcontroller

## Microcontroller Connection
The final step involves connecting the circuit to a microcontroller. I appreciate the safety reminder to check voltage levels before making connections.

## Reflections


This project seems challenging but rewarding. I'm excited to see how I can apply this EMG circuit in future projects. The potential applications in gaming, robotics, and even medical fields are truly inspiring.












### MOM 

- filter simulator 
- find what amps are used in upside down labs
- electrode -> Amplifying -> filter -> rectify -> esp32
- 12Bjdc converter (analog to digital convertor)
