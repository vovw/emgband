What is our project?
--------------------

We read Electromyography (EMG) data using sensors, amplify it, filter it, perform ADC conversion, and conduct a frequency analysis (FFT) on it. Using the analyzed data, we train an ML model that can understand what hand movement was performed to get those readings.
Later those Readings are fed into a ML model to recognize and classify those motions.
